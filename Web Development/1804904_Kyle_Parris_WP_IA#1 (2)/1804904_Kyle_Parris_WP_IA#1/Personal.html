		<font size="4">According to the personality test done on <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/"><font color="black">16personalities.com</font></a> my defining character traits are Introverted	-	89%, Intuitive	-	59%, Thinking	-	57%, Judging	-	57%, Assertive	-	68% which would give me a INTJ-A personality type “The Architect” according to Jung personality type descriptions. I would agree with this assement to an extent because this personality type is said to pertray most of the traits I admire about myself it also gave a list of careers I would be suited for and some of them are jobs I myself found interesting.</font><br><br>
		<h1 align="center"><a name="likes">About Me</a></h1><br>
		<font size="4">My hobbies include reading, watching tv, playing video games,  playing chess, playing football and photography. I have four sibilings (1 sister and 3 brothers) of the five of us I am the third child but the first for my mother. My favorite books to read are The Harry Potter Series of Books by J.K Rowling, The Percy Jackson Series of Books by Rick Riordan, The Anita Blake Series of Books by Laurell K Hamilton, Bleach Manga by Tite Kubo and Solo Leveling Manga by Chugong. My favorite things to watch are Avatar the Last Air Bender, The Rising of the Sheild Hero, Teen Wolf, The Big Bang Theory, Bones and The movies which make up the <abbr title="Marvel Cinematic Universe">MCU</abbr>. I chose my personal motto to be "Everthing happens for a reason" not because it was said by someone I looked up to but because I strongly beleive that everything that happens will find a way to work itself out in the end, if not for you but for someone else like (cause and effect) or (regression to the mean - nothing can remain too bad or too good before long it always goes back to normal).</font><br>
