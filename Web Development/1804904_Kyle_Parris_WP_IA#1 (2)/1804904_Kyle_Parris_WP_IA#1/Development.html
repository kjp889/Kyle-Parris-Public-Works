			<ul>
				<li>My intuition</li>
				<li>My ability to learn</li>
				<li>My ability to remain calm under stress</li>
				<li>and My determination to achieve anything I set my mind on.</li>
			</ul>
		I have spent the last couple of years working on my weeknesses by tring to be more out going, interacting more with my neigbours in the name of bettering myself in the case of my srtengths I have been feeding my ability to learn and indulging my curiosity by reading more and practicing the things I learnt, I believe that a person should maintain his/her strengths but put more effort in strentening their weeknesses in order to be wellrounded and centered as an individual.</font>
